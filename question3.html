      <h1>3. Workers not applied</h1>

        Hi there, José Miguel from Cloudflare Support!
        
        I know it can be confusing when things work in the debugger but not live — been there myself. This usually happens when the Worker isn't attached to a route that matches real traffic.<br />
        Check the “Triggers” section in the dashboard and make sure you've set a route like <code>example.com/*</code>.
        Let me know if that helps or if you'd like a hand checking the setup.
      </div>

      <h2>Thought Process</h2>
      <h3>How I approached this question</h3>
      <p>
        I don't have direct experience deploying Workers through the Dashboard — my answer is based on research and Cloudflare's official documentation. I reviewed several key sections to confirm the relationship between Worker triggers, routes, and proxied traffic.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Concepts Researched</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Workers only run on requests that match an explicitly defined route.</li>
        <li>The DNS record must be proxied for the Worker to execute.</li>
        <li>The Debugger tool runs in isolation and doesn't confirm full deployment behavior.</li>
      </ul>
