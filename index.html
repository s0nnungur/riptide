            1. Site down, your nameservers are down
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">I am having trouble reaching my website http://example.com/ from different networks. Are your nameservers working properly?</p>
        </li>

            2. Why is my site coming from California?!
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">I'm in London, but looking at your IPs it shows that you are serving my website from California. Can that be right? Why is that? I thought you were supposed to serve my website from some places close to me?</p>
        </li>

            3. Workers not applied
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</p>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">

            4. Cloudflare Nameservers
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">How are Cloudflare's nameservers different from the DNS provided by Google DNS or OpenDNS? Can I delegate to Cloudflare nameservers while still using my host's DNS?</p>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <a href="question5.html" style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #faad3f; text-decoration: none;">
            5. Content not Being Cached
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">After activating Cloudflare on my site, I am seeing that resources on my pages are not being cached;</p>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          <a href="question6.html" style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #faad3f; text-decoration: none;">
            6. Redirection based on user agent
          </a>
          <p style="color: #555;">I want to redirect visitor with specific user agent (*MSIE 8.0* for example) to a different page. It seems this is not possible with Cloudflare Page Rules. Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</p>
