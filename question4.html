        4. Cloudflare Nameservers vs. Google DNS/OpenDNS
      </h1>

      <h2>Response</h2>
      <div class="response-block">
        Hi there, José Miguel from Cloudflare Support!
        
        Cloudflare's nameservers host your DNS settings. Google DNS and OpenDNS don't host anything — they just look up DNS records to help users reach your site.<br /><br />
        If you point your nameservers to Cloudflare, Cloudflare becomes your DNS provider. That means you'll want to make sure all your DNS records (like A or CNAME records) are correctly added to Cloudflare.
      </div>

      <h2>Thought Process</h2>

      <h3>What I gathered through research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloudflare Nameservers</strong> are authoritative — meaning they answer DNS queries based on the records you configure in Cloudflare.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google DNS / OpenDNS</strong> are public resolvers — they retrieve DNS info, but don't manage your DNS settings themselves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common scenario</h3>
      <p>
        I looked into how Cloudflare works when hosting providers are involved. It's common to host a site elsewhere but still delegate DNS to Cloudflare. In that case, users should:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Change their domain's nameservers at the registrar to the ones Cloudflare provides</li>
        <li>Add matching DNS records in Cloudflare that point to their host's IP address</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Partial (CNAME) Setup</h3>
      <p>
        I also came across something called a <strong>CNAME setup</strong>. This lets users keep their current DNS provider but still route specific subdomains through Cloudflare. This seems to be more relevant on Enterprise plans.
      </p>

      <h3>Example DNS Record</h3>
      <pre>
Type: A
Name: example.com
Content: 192.0.2.123
Proxy status: Proxied
      </pre>

      <p>
        This example shows how Cloudflare can direct traffic to a third-party host while still applying its protection and performance features.
